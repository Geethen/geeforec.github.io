**Practical 4: Long-term patterns of rainfall in and around Braulio Carrillo National Park in Costa Rica**

Access the completed practical script [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c4d468cecb9f6291185379c1c6a12fd8?noload=true)

**Learning Objectives**
By the end of this practical you should be able to:

1. Access long-term rainfall data
2. Summarise temporal data by region
3. Generate interactive map
4. Generate time-series plots
5. Output data (csv, rasterStack) for analysis outside of GEE
6. Explore understanding of rainfall as a driver of ecosystem processes (e.g. comparison with vegetation dynamics e.g. previous practical #3)
***

**Introduction**
Rainfall plays a central role in a myriad of natural processes, including river health, the transportation of nutrients, soil moisture, vegetation dynamics, fire regimes, animal movement and distribution patterns and landscape heterogeneity. Within protected areas these processes function together to safeguard ecosystem integrity. In the face of current climate change predictions, the spatio-temporal patterns of rainfall is an increasingly important component to include in any ecological study (MacFadyen et al 2018). Here we explore patterns of monthly rainfall across Costa Rica and the Braulio Carrillo National Park from 2000 to 2019 (20 years). We'll summarise monthly and annual rainfall patterns using line charts and examine the long-term spatial patterns of rainfall using an interactive map. Lastly, we'll take a look at how the temporal patterns of annual rainfall compares to those of vegetation vigour or 'greenness', highlighting its importance as a bottom-up ecosystem driver.
***

**Data import**
The datasets we will use for this practical are all available on Google Earth Engine and can be accessed as follows:
```js
var costaRica = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB/2017');
var braulio = ee.FeatureCollection('WCMC/WDPA/current/polygons');
var rainAll = ee.ImageCollection("UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/PENTAD");
var eviAll = ee.ImageCollection("MODIS/006/MOD13Q1");
```
The first dataset, [LSIB 2017](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WCMC_WDPA_current_polygons), contains polygon representations of all international boundaries. The second, [WDPA](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WCMC_WDPA_current_polygons), contains polygons of all the world's protected areas. The third, [CHIRPS](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_PENTAD), is a gridded rainfall time series dataset (Funk et al 2015) and the last, [MOD13Q1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MOD13Q1), provides vegetation indexes (NDVI and EVI) depicting vegetation 'greenness' per 250m pixel.
***

**Filtering data**
First define variables for the temporal window of interest, including a start-date, end-date and the range of years and months. We will use these variables later to filter and summarise the long-term data.
```js
var startDate = ee.Date.fromYMD(2000,1,1);
var endDate = ee.Date.fromYMD(2019,12,31);
var years = ee.List.sequence(2000, 2019);
var months = ee.List.sequence(1, 12);
```
Then filter our polygon features to our areas of interest (AOI), namely Costa Rica and Braulio Carrillo protected area. At the same time, convert these two FeatureCollections to geometry objects as we'll need them later as function parameters for functions we'll build.
```js
var costaRica = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB/2017')
.filter(ee.Filter.inList('COUNTRY_NA', ['Costa Rica']));
var costaRica_geo = costaRica.geometry();

var braulio = ee.FeatureCollection('WCMC/WDPA/current/polygons')
.filter(ee.Filter.stringContains('ORIG_NAME', 'Braulio Carrillo'));
var braulio_geo = braulio.geometry();
```
Now filter the CHIRPS ImageCollection for rainfall (i.e. `'precipitation'`) and the MODIS MOD13Q1 product for the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) instead of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) used in the previous practical. At the same time, filter by date range and our AOI to speed up all analyses that follow.
```js
var rainAll = ee.ImageCollection("UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/PENTAD")
.select('precipitation')
.filterDate(startDate, endDate)
.filterBounds(costaRica_geo);

var eviAll = ee.ImageCollection("MODIS/006/MOD13Q1")
.select('EVI')
.filterDate(startDate, endDate)
.filterBounds(costaRica_geo);
```
***

**Processing**
To calculate the annual monthly sum of rainfall across Braulio Carrillo National Park from 2000 to 2019, reduce the monthly rainfall records by their sum per year as follows:
```js
var rainYr_list =  years.map(function(y){
var rain_year = rainAll.filter(ee.Filter.calendarRange(y, y, 'year'))
.sum().rename('rain_yr');
var time = ee.Image(ee.Date.fromYMD(y,1,1)
.millis()).divide(1e18).toFloat(); //  number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
return rain_year.addBands(time).set('year', y).set('month', 1)
.set('system:time_start', ee.Date.fromYMD(y,1,1));
});
```
This produces a list of 20 images. Convert the list back to an ImageCollection and calculate the long-term annual rainfall patterns for Costa Rica as follows:
```js
// Convert the image List to an ImageCollection.
var rainYr = ee.ImageCollection.fromImages(rainYr_list);
// Calculate long-term annual rainfall clipped to Costa Rica
var rainAnnual = rainYr.mean().clip(costaRica);
```
***

**Visualisation**
Now let's plot these results on a map. First define the various map elements i.e. the `title` and `symbology` for the legend as follows:
```js
var title = ui.Label('Costa Rica: Annual Rainfall 2000 to 2018', {
  stretch: 'horizontal',
  textAlign: 'center',
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  fontSize: '20px'});

var rainYvis = {
  min: 2100, max: 3800, 
  palette: 'ffffff, 67d9f1, 1036cb'};
```
Next, we centre the map to Costa Rica - In this way all other layers will now align with this parent map. Now add the long-term mean annual rainfall for Costa Rica and the Braulio Carrillo boundary. Lastly add the defined title.
```js
Map.centerObject(costaRica, 8);
Map.addLayer(rainAnnual, rainYvis, 'Long-term Annual Rainfall'); 
Map.addLayer(braulio,{color: 'grey'}, 'Braulio Carrillo',true, 0.8);  
Map.add(title);
```

***

**Charting**
Now let's chart annual rainfall results but summarised for Braulio Carrillo National Park using a line chart. First define the chart parameters (e.g. title and axis labels) and then create the line chart.
```js
var opt_chart_annualPrecip = {
  title: 'Annual Rainfall: Braulio Carrillo',
  pointSize: 3,
  hAxis: {title: 'Year'},
  vAxis: {title: 'Rainfall (mm)'},
};

var chart_annualPrecip = ui.Chart.image.series({
  imageCollection: rainYr.select('rain_yr'),
  region:myBraulio_geo,
  reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(),
  scale: 5000
}).setOptions(opt_chart_annualPrecip);
// print(chart_annualPrecip);
```
We could use `print()` to see the chart in the GEE console but for this practical we'll add the chart to our map  layout instead. To do this, first make a panel to hold the chart in the map, then add the empty panel to the map and fill it with your chart:
```js
// Create a panel to hold the chart in the map
var panel = ui.Panel();
panel.style().set({
  width: '350px',
  position: 'bottom-left'
});
// Add empty panel to map
Map.add(panel);
// Add chart to panel
panel.add(chart_annualPrecip)
```

**Relationship between annual rainfall and vegetation 'greenness'**
Combine the calculation of annual max rainfall with annual maximum EVI for Costa Rica for the same period, 2000 to 2019. Then convert the list that is returned, back to an ImageCollection, including a `flatten()` command as follows:
```js
var annualRainEVI_list =  years.map(function(y){
  var evi_year = eviAll.filter(ee.Filter.calendarRange(y, y, 'year'))
  .max().multiply(0.0001).rename('evi');
  var img = rainAll.filter(ee.Filter.calendarRange(y, y, 'year'))
  .max().rename('rain');
  var time = ee.Image(ee.Date.fromYMD(y,1,1).millis()).divide(1e18).toFloat(); //  number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
  return img.addBands([evi_year, time]).set('year', y).set('month', 1)
  .set('system:time_start', ee.Date.fromYMD(y,1,1));
});

// // Convert the image List to an ImageCollection.
var annualRainEVI = ee.ImageCollection.fromImages(annualRainEVI_list.flatten());
```
Now plot both rainfall and EVI in a single chart. What do you think the relationship between these two variables will be?
To create a comparative line chart of rainfall and EVI summaries for Braulio Carrillo, first define the chart parameters and then create the line chart with two y-axes as follows:
```js
var opt_annualRainEVI = {title: "Annual Max Rainfall vs. EVI for Braulio Carrillo", pointSize: 3,
    legend: {maxLines: 5, position: 'top'},
    series: { 0: {targetAxisIndex: 0},
              1: {targetAxisIndex: 1}},
        vAxes: {Adds titles to each axis.
          0: {title: 'Max EVI (*0.0001)'},
          1: {title: 'Max Rainfall (mm)'}},};

var rain_ndvi_chart = ui.Chart.image.series({
  imageCollection: annualRainEVI.select(['evi', 'rain']),
  region:myBraulio_geo,
  reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(),
  scale: 5000
}).setOptions(opt_annualRainEVI);
print(rain_ndvi_chart);
```

**Data Export**
To export the data shown in the created charts, you can simply `maximise` the chart and then click `Download` to export to formats `.CSV`, `.SVG` or `.PNG`.

![](/images/prac4_f5.png)
**Figure 7:** The easiest way to export data plotted in a chart is to click the `maximise` button on the chart in your console area (1) and then click `Download CSV` (2) to export a .csv table to your local hard-drive.

Alternatively, you may script the export. This option will allow you to customise formats for your exported table. For example, a formatted date field using a reducer to get the mean rainfall value for Braulio Carrillo for each year. The exported csv table will then contain a column for both date and mean annual rainfall. Once the task is completed, you will find this csv file in your google drive.
```js
var csv_annualPrecip = annualPrecip.map(function(image){
var year = image.get('year');
var month = image.get('month');
var mean = image.reduceRegion({
reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(),
geometry: myBraulio_geo,
scale: 5000
});  
return ee.Feature(null, {'mean': mean.get('rain'),
'year': year})
});

Export.table.toDrive({
collection: csv_annualPrecip,
description: 'annualRain',
folder: 'testOTS',
fileFormat: 'CSV'
});
```

**Figure 8:** Steps followed to complete a CSV export task using a script to initialise a table export to your local hard-drive.

In addition, to the export options presented above and in practical 3. You may also export the results as a rasterStack with multiple layers representing the sum of annual rainfall for Costa Rica. We will first create a list of band names for the rasterStack output and apply the function `toBands()` to the image collection to stack all bands into a single image. Each band will contain a unique name corresponding to, in this example, the year of the annual sum.
```js
var band_names = annualPrecip.map(function(image) {
return ee.Feature(null, {'date': ee.Date(image.get('date'))
.format('YYYY_MM')})})
.aggregate_array('date')
print('Band Names', band_names);

var stack_RainEVI = annualPrecip.toBands().rename(band_names);

// Export a cloud-optimized GeoTIFF.
// i.e. rasterStack with 20 layers, representing annual rain from 2000 to 2019
Export.image.toDrive({
image: stack_RainEVI,
folder: 'testOTS',
description: 'Rainfall_Sums',
scale: 5000,
region: myBraulio_geo,
fileFormat: 'GeoTIFF',
formatOptions: {
cloudOptimized: true
}
});
```
The last step, as always, save the script.

**Bonus Section**
Similarly, you can calculate monthly rainfall for each year in Braulio Carrillo National Park from 2000 to 2019 by reducing the monthly rainfall records by their sum per year and month as follows:
```js
var rainMeanMY_list = years.map(function(y) {
  return months.map(function(m) {
  return rainAll
    .filter(ee.Filter.calendarRange(y,y, 'year')) // Filter images by date range 
    .filter(ee.Filter.calendarRange(m,m, 'month')) // Filter images by date range
    .reduce(ee.Reducer.sum()).rename('rain_mnth') // Reduce the resulting image collection by mean
    .set('yrmnth', ee.Date.fromYMD(y, m, 1)) // .set('year',ee.Date(ee.String(y)).format('YYYY'))
    .set('name','rainfall');
});
});
```
