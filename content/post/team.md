**Geethen Singh**

Geethen Singh is a PhD candidate at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. He is interested in applying earth observation and machine learning within the domain of ecology and is currently working on better understanding invasive species spread and the invasive risk posed using earth observation-based monitoring.

**Sandra MacFadyen**

Sandra MacFadyen is a landscape ecologist interested in macroscale ecosystem dynamics, with an emphasis on applied spatial statistics for biodiversity conservation. Based in the Kruger National Park as a postdoctoral researcher (Mathematical Bioscience Hub, Mathematical Sciences, Stellenbosch University) her research interests focus on exploring the links between patterns and processes to develop a more holistic understanding of ecosystem dynamics in large protected areas.

**Joseph White**

Joseph White is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, working on species distribution shifts and disrupted ecosystem services in response to global change using occupancy models and remote sensed products. He is interested in spatial ecology and using earth observation to provide ecological and conservation insights.

**Donovon Tye**

Donovan Tye is the Field Director for the Organization for Tropical Studies in Skukuza, South Africa. His research has centered on understanding the determinants of species assemblages in disturbance-prone ecosystems. More recently, he has become increasingly interested in the application of emerging technologies in the realm of biodiversity science. In particular, the application of remote sensing products and automated recorders in savanna systems.

**Bernard Coetzee**

Bernard is a lecturer with OTS and a Research Associate with the Global Change Institute, at the University of the Witwatersrand. He studies how humans are altering the biosphere, what that means for our well-being, and for the conservation of the species we share our planet with. His current focus is on artificial light spread and disease vector interactions.
