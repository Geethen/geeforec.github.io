**Geethen Singh**

Geethen Singh is a PhD candidate at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. He is interested in applying earth observation and machine learning within the domain of ecology and is currently working on better understanding invasive species spread and the invasive risk posed using earth observation-based monitoring.

**Sandra MacFadyen**

Sandra MacFadyen is a landscape ecologist interested in macroscale ecosystem dynamics, with an emphasis on applied spatial statistics for biodiversity conservation. Based in the Kruger National Park as a postdoctoral researcher (Mathematical Bioscience Hub, Mathematical Sciences, Stellenbosch University) her research interests focus on exploring the links between patterns and processes to develop a more holistic understanding of ecosystem dynamics in large protected areas.

**Bernard Coetzee**

Bernard is a lecturer with OTS and a Research Associate with the Global Change Institute, at the University of the Witwatersrand. He studies how humans are altering the biosphere, what that means for our well-being, and for the conservation of the species we share our planet with. His current focus is on artificial light spread and disease vector interactions.
