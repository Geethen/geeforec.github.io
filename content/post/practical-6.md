**Practical 6: Fire frequency in the Kruger National Park, South Africa**

Access the completed practical script [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/63ca391e02cb163916a03a2c45200359?noload=true)
Also please download the following shapefile delineating [regional boundaries](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Acs8PLINsehpsZvDj-g9BnAkLuVYKVv3/view?usp=sharing) in Kruger.

**Learning Objectives**
By the end of this practical you should be able to:
1. Access terrain model data from SRTM
2. Access monthly burn scar data
3. Generate a hillshade using SRTM data
4. Explore long-term patterns of fire frequency
5. Build an animation and output for use in, for example, PowerPoint presentations
***

**Introduction**
Fire is an important driver of landscape pattern, as different fire regimes directly affect biomass production, composition and structure of vegetation. Indirectly, and together with other landscape features like geology, rainfall and topography, fire also influences animal distribution patterns. In savanna systems, interactions between herbivory, fire frequency, fire intensity and season can alter tree:grass ratios and system states. For example, in the Kruger National Park (Kruger) landscapes that are burnt frequently by high intensity fires generally have less woody cover than those burnt less frequently, at low intensities. Fire regime can also influence vegetation composition, where fire adapted species may dominate in frequently burnt areas, while those areas less frequently burnt may provide important refugia for more fire sensitive species (Smit et al. 2013). Fire is therefore an important component for biodiversity conservation planning but how do we find information about fire frequencies, intensities and seasons for our areas of interest if we haven’t monitored it directly? GEE has a number of different [datasets tagged "fire"](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/tags/fire). We'll just be looking at one in this practical but I encourage you to explore the others in your own time. Let’s get started……
***

**Data import**
In addition to datasets available on Google Earth Engine, in this practical we will learn how to import shapefiles from your local hard-drive into GEE by uploading them as new assets (Fig. 1).
```js
var dem = ee.Image("CGIAR/SRTM90_V4");
var FireCCI = ee.ImageCollection('ESA/CCI/FireCCI/5_1');
```
The first dataset, [SRTM90](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CGIAR_SRTM90_V4), is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The second, [FireCCI51](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_CCI_FireCCI_5_1), is a Fire_cci Burned Area pixel product version 5.1 from MODIS. Figure 1 below, describes how to import the boundary shapefile for the Kruger National Park (Kruger) from files stored locally on your hard-drive. You can download and save the required files from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omD5vPk4LMQSnC2BHJCg6GlnmpzBsFQG/view?usp=sharing).

**Filtering data**
First define your variables for the temporal and spatial windows of interest. We will use these variables to filter our data before processing.
```js
var startDate = ee.Date.fromYMD(2001,1,1);
var endDate = ee.Date.fromYMD(2018,12,31);
var years = ee.List(fire.aggregate_array('year')).distinct().sort();

var knp_geo = knp.geometry();

var srtm = dem.clipToCollection(knp);

var fire = FireCCI
    .filterBounds(knp_geo)
    .filterDate(startDate, endDate)
    .map(function(img) { // This function adds year as property to each image
      return img.set('year', ee.Image(img).date().get('year'));
    });
```
***

**Processing**
Now build a function to remove all burn scars from the fire dataset that have a confidence interval of less than 50%.
```js
// Define a function to remove all fires <50% confidence interval
var confMask = function(img) {
  var conf = img.select('ConfidenceLevel');
  var level = conf.gt(50);
  return img.updateMask(level).select('BurnDate'); //return only 'BurnDate' band
};
```
Run the function and summarise the burn scars by the day-of-year (doy) most frequently burnt, followed by the the frequency areas are burnt in Kruger annually from 2001 until 2018.
```js
// Most frequently burnt DOY
var fireDOY_list = years.map(function(year) {
  return fire
    .filterMetadata('year', 'equals', year) // Filter image collection by year
    .map(confMask) // Apply confidence mask >50%
    .reduce(ee.Reducer.mode()).rename('fire_doy') // Reduce image collection by most common DOY
    .set('year', year) // Set composite year as an image property
    .set('system:time_start', ee.Date.fromYMD(year, 1, 1));
});
var doyFires = ee.ImageCollection.fromImages(fireDOY_list); // Convert the image List back to an ImageCollection

// Frequency of days burnt
var fireCnt_list = years.map(function(year) {
  return fire
    .filterMetadata('year', 'equals', year) // Filter image collection by year
    .map(confMask) // Apply confidence mask >50%
    .reduce(ee.Reducer.countDistinct()) // Reduce image collection by count distinct doy
    .set('year', year) ));// Set composite year as an image property
    .set('system:time_start', ee.Date.fromYMD(year, 1, 1
});
var cntFiresDOY = ee.ImageCollection.fromImages(fireCnt_list); // Convert the image List back to an ImageCollection
```
Summarise these results to represent the most frequently burnt day-of-year (doy) and the frequency areas have burnt in Kruger over the last 18 years (2001-2018).
```js
var modFires = doyFires.mode().clip(knp_geo);
var cntFires = cntFiresDOY.sum().clip(knp_geo);
```
***

**Charting**
To plot these results, first define your chart parameters (e.g. title and axis labels), then create the line chart, incorporating these pre-defined chart parameters and `print` it to the console as follows:
```js
// Chart parameters
var opt_cntFireMonth = {
  title: 'Monthly fire frequencies: Kruger National Park 2001 to 2018',
  pointSize: 3,
  hAxis: {title: 'Year'},
  vAxis: {title: 'Number of fires'},
};

// Plot day count of monthly fires
var cntFireMonth_chart = ui.Chart.image.series({ // ui.Chart.image.byRegion
  imageCollection: fire.select('BurnDate'),
  region: knp_geo,
  reducer: ee.Reducer.countDistinct(),
  scale: 250
}).setOptions(opt_cntFireMonth).setChartType('LineChart');
print(cntFireMonth_chart);
```

**Visualisation**
To visualise the long-term summaries of your results, first setup your map elements as you've done in previous practicals.
```js
// Define legend parameters for unique DOY
// Light colours are earlier in the year, dark colours are later
var visDOY = {
    min:1, max:366, 
    palette:['eef5b7','99f74f','4ff7b0','4fc2f7',
    '3940db','7239db','db39db','db395c','7c1229']};

// Define a legend for fire frequency
// Light colours are areas that burn less frequently, 
// dark colours are areas that burn often
var visCnt = {
    min:1, max:12, 
    palette:['eef5b7','99f74f','4ff7b0','4fc2f7','3940db',
             '7239db','db39db','db395c','7c1229']};

Map.centerObject(knp, 7);
Map.addLayer(modFires, visDOY, 'Most frequently burnt day in Kruger (2001-2018)',true, 0.8)
Map.addLayer(cntFires, visCnt, 'Fire frequency: Kruger Park (2001-2018)',true, 0.8)
Map.addLayer(knp,{color: 'grey'}, 'Kruger',true, 0.8);  // Add Kruger boundary
```

**Hillshade and Animation**
```js
//display hillshading and slope
var hillshade = ee.Terrain.hillshade(dem);
// print('Check hillshade',hillshade);

// Set the clipped SRTM image as background
var srtmVis = hillshade.visualize(srtmParams);

// Define GIF visualization parameters
var gifParams = {
  'region': knp_geo,
  'dimensions': 500,
  'crs': 'EPSG:3857', // Check projection
  'framesPerSecond': 1
};

// Define the hillshade background legend parameters
var srtmParams = {
  min: 120, // Elevation min 100
  max: 200, // Elevation max 840
  gamma: 1,
};

// Create RGB visualization images for use as animation frames.
var srtmFires = doyFires.map(function(img) {
  return srtmVis
        .paint(knp, 'grey', 1) // Add KNP boundary
        .blend(img.visualize(visDOY).clipToCollection(knp)); // Blend hillshade with knp and clip
});

// Print the GIF URL to the console
var myGIF = srtmFires.getVideoThumbURL(gifParams);
print(myGIF);

// Render the GIF animation in the console
print(ui.Thumbnail({
  image: srtmFires,
  params: gifParams,
  style: {
    position: 'bottom-right',
    width: '180px'
  }}));

// Or add it to your map
// Create a video thumbnail and add it to the map.
var thumb = ui.Thumbnail({
  // Specifying a collection for "image" animates the sequence of images.
  image: srtmFires,
  params: gifParams,
  style: {
    position: 'bottom-right',
    width: '180px'
  }});
Map.add(thumb);
```

**Data Export**
To export the animation, simply right mouse-click and select `Save Image As…` to save the animation locally as a .GIF file to your hard-drive.

As a last step is always "save your script".
